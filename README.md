# JavaScript Falsy Value Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in JavaScript related to how the language treats falsy values within conditional statements. The bug involves a function that unintentionally handles only `null` values and overlooks other falsy values like `0` or empty strings.  The solution clarifies the handling of these values to improve robustness and prevent unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description:
The initial code is designed to handle `null` values appropriately, returning 0 when either input is `null`. However, it does not explicitly check for other falsy values.  This oversight leads to incorrect results or runtime errors when these values are passed to the function.
